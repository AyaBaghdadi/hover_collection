## IOS Swift : Explain Higher-order Function Examples

```
1. Map
2. compactMap
3. flatMap // deprecated
4. filter
5. reduce
6. forEach
7. contains
8. removeAll
9. sorted
10. split

```

### Short Definition

```
* Map This function performs an process on all the elements and returns a new collection with the results of the proces on the original elements.
* compactMap Function is similar to map with this difference -> the result array does not contain any nil values.
* faltMap Is useful when there are collections inside collections But -> it’s “ Deprecated “
* Filter It's purpose is to filter the elements of a collection based on a condition and produce a new one containing only those elements that satisfy the condition.
* Reduce Produce one value from the values of all elements in a collection. 
* forEach It provides a closure that implements the custom logic. 
* Contains Check if there are elements that satisfy a certain condition and it returns a boolean value. 
* removeAll Similar to [ contains ] when it’s necessary to remove collection elements based on conditions that regard the actual element values.
* Sorted Data in ascending order is easy in Swift using the sorted().
* Split Used with String values and its purpose is to split a string into pieces based on a given condition. The result is an array of substrings.
